# 3-Point shooting evolution: NBA vs EuroLeague

### Introduction

Over the last decade, both the NBA and EuroLeague have witnessed a sharp rise in 3-point attempts (3PA). While it might seem intuitive that more long-distance shots would decrease overall shooting accuracy (FG%), the data may tell a different story. This project investigates whether this trend has negatively affected field goal percentages, or if players and teams have adapted efficiently.

### Objective

- Analyze the year-over-year growth in 3PA for both leagues
- Examine whether this shift has negatively affected FG%
- Compare trends between leagues to identify similarities or key differences

### Hypothesis

1. Over the last 10 years, the rise in 3-point attempts (3PA) has not lowered field goal percentage (FG%) in the NBA or EuroLeague, in fact, FG% has improved year-over-year.


### Data Sources

Data for this project has been sourced from the following:
- NBA Stats API
- EuroLeague API

### Methodology

1. Collect 10 years of NBA and EuroLeague team-level 3PA and FG% data
2. Clean and standardize datasets
3. Normalize seasons and align date ranges
4. Analyze YoY trends in 3PA and FG%
5. Visualize correlations and test the hypothesis

### Conclusion

The final analysis will clarify whether the modern shift to long-range shooting has truly compromised shooting efficiency, or if players and teams have simply become better at adapting.
