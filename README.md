# 3-Point shooting efficency evolution: NBA vs EuroLeague

### Introduction

In the past decade, both the NBA and EuroLeague have seen a notable increase in 3-point shooting. While itâ€™s often assumed that shooting more 3s could lead to a drop in accuracy, the data may tell a different story. This project investigates whether teams have become not only more reliant on 3-pointers, but also more efficient, challenging assumptions about volume vs. efficiency in modern basketball.

### Objective

- Year-over-year trends in average 3PA and 3P%
- Correlation between increased volume and accuracy
- League-wide shooting evolution in both competitions

### Hypothesis

Over the last 10 years, the rise in average 3-point attempts (av3PA) has not lowered 3-point percentage (3P%) in the NBA or EuroLeague, in fact, 3P% has improved year-over-year.

### Data Sources

Data for this project has been sourced from the following:
- NBA Stats API
- EuroLeague API

### Methodology

1. Collect 10 years of NBA and EuroLeague team-level 3PA and FG% data
2. Clean and standardize datasets
3. Normalize seasons and align date ranges
4. Analyze YoY trends in av3PA and FG%
5. Visualize correlations and test the hypothesis

### Conclusion

The final analysis will clarify whether the modern shift to long-range shooting has truly compromised shooting efficiency, or if players and teams have simply become better at adapting.
