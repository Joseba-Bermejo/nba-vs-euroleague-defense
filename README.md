# 3-Point shooting efficency evolution: NBA vs EuroLeague

### Introduction

Over the past decade, both the NBA and EuroLeague have experienced a significant rise in 3-point attempts. While it’s commonly believed that increased volume might reduce efficiency due to the shot’s difficulty, this project explores whether teams have not only relied more on 3-pointers but also sustained, or even improved, their accuracy. The goal is to challenge traditional assumptions about the trade-off between volume and efficiency in modern basketball.

### Objective

- Year-over-year trends in average 3PA and 3P%
- Correlation between increased volume and accuracy
- League-wide shooting evolution in both competitions

### Hypothesis

Despite the rise in average 3-point attempts (av3PA) over the past decade, 3-point shooting accuracy (3P%) in both the NBA and EuroLeague has remained stable, or even improved, year over year.

### Data Sources

Data for this project has been sourced from:
- [NBA Stats API](https://pypi.org/project/nba_api)
- [EuroLeague API](https://pypi.org/project/euroleague-api)

### Methodology

1. Collect 10 years of NBA and EuroLeague team-level av3PA and 3P% data
2. Clean and standardize datasets
3. Normalize seasons and align date ranges for comparison
4. Analyze YoY trends in av3PA and 3P%
5. Visualize correlations and test the hypothesis

### Conclusion

The final analysis will clarify whether the modern shift to long-range shooting has truly compromised shooting efficiency, or if players and teams have simply become better at adapting.
