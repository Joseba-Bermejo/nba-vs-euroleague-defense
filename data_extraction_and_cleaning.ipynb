    "### Introduction\n",
    "In the past decade, both the NBA and EuroLeague have seen a notable increase in 3-point shooting. While it’s often assumed that shooting more 3s could lead to a drop in accuracy, the data may tell a different story. This project investigates whether teams have become not only more reliant on 3-pointers, but also more efficient, challenging assumptions about volume vs. efficiency in modern basketball.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Analyze YoY trends in average 3PA and 3P%\n",
    "- Evaluate the correlation between increased volume and accuracy\n",
    "- Compare the league-wide shooting evolution in both competitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Over the last 10 years, the rise in average 3-point attempts (av3PA) has not lowered 3-point percentage (3P%) in the NBA or EuroLeague, in fact, 3P% has improved year-over-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics involved\n",
    "- av3P (Average 3 Point Attempts): The number of shots a team takes from beyond the three-point line per season on average.\n",
    "- 3P% (Three-Point Percentage): Measures how accurately teams shoot from beyond the three point line."
